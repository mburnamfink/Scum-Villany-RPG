# Name
Silas Rayburn

# Alias
Frost

# Look
Silas is lanky from spending most of his life as a spacer. He wears the standard
issue charcoal grey overalls from his mining days. Though the many pockets now
serve to hold small relics from his travels. He is often holding a small chunk
of Way Glass that he rubs for good luck. It doesn't always help at the dice
table.

# Heritage

Spacer - Grew up with a family working the ice belts.

# Background

Labor - Worked as an ice miner.

# Starting Ability

The Way: You can spend a gambit instead of paying any stress cost.

# Special Ability

- Kinetics: _Push yourself_ throw table size object with dangerous force, or propel yourself briefly with superhuman speed

# Friend

- Laxx, a xeno that Silas helped escape from some low-level Cobalt members. He is a good source of
information on the Way and helped Silas obtain the Codex Geli.

# Rival

- Horux, a former friend that saw Silas' discovery of his "void suit". Feels that
Silas abandoned his friends in his rush to leave the mining life.

# Vice

- Gambling: A habit picked up while mining. One of the few past-times available while out in the field.
- Stupor: A way to forget how it feels to interact with the Way. Particularly after using the void suit.
